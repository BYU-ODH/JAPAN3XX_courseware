      These beginning words are well-known enough that all Japanese are familiar with them.  Changed to modern Japanese the passage reads, "The water that streams in a flowing river never comes to a stop, but the water that flows there now is not the same as the original water. Of the bubbles floating on the stagnant pools, which seem to disappear at one moment and appear in another, there are none that last very long. The people living in this world and their houses are like that too."
