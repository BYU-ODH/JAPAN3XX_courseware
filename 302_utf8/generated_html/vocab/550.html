       Definition:
      </b>
      the preceeding-noun form for adjectives in classical Japanese is「き」instead of the modern Japanese 「い」.  One might sometimes read 「よき友達」for "good friend” or here 「みじかき運」for "short life,” "short-fated existence.” Furthermore, meanings of words have changed over the 800 years since Chomei wrote these words.  Some scholars would say that みじかき運 would be better rendered in modern Japanese as 「はかない運命」“my evanescent fate” or 「不運」“my unfortunate existence.”
