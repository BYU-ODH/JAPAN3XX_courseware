    This CD is designed to enrich your   study with audio and visual materials. This helps you absorb the information   presented here more thoroughly and retain it longer. We suggest that you click   on kanji and sound files as frequently as possible.

    The   CD is not intended to add to your study load, but we believe that the time you   spend CD-surfing will be beneficial when you really think about   each story and internalize the objects of the lesson. You should not force yourself   into mere memorization; rather, surf around to absorb the material in a more   relaxed way.
