       Explanation:
      </b>
      This is very similar to "V (Base II) にくい" but gives more literary (or written) flavor and is used for more conceptual or abstract things, e.g. hard to express or hard to understand, etc.  Note ありがたい of ありがとう comes from "difficult to exist," in other words, "rare things," or "precious things," which developed to express a feeling of gratitude on the part of the speaker.
