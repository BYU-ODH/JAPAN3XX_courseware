       Explanation:
      </b>
      In order to understand this pattern, you must know another related pattern: 〜ふりをする "to put on airs," as in 先生のふりをする "Act as if [you] are a teacher," 寝たふりをする "Act as if [you] were asleep," 知らないふりをする "Pretend like [you] don’t know," or 元気なふりをする "Pretend like [I] am fine," etc.  V (Base II) ぶり is a noun (pseudonoun) indicating a manner of a style in which the verb is performed. ふり becomes ぶり because V (Base II) is considered a noun and two nouns combined become a compound noun. The initial voiceless obstruent of the second noun in the compound noun becomes voiced as in 生活ぶり.
