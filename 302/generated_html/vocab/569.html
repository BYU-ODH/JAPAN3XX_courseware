      An abbreviation for 妙法蓮華経（みょうほうれんげきょう）.This scripture is technically known in Sanskrit (the ancient language of India in which the Buddhist scriptures were originally written)as the Saddharma Pundarika Sutra. But the scripture’s name is translated literally into English as the Sutra on the Lotus of the wonderful Law. Perhaps this scripture is best known in English simply as the "Lotus Sutra.”
