      The "Kiritsubo" chapter, which begins with the words, "In some royal reign or another, among the many concubines and consorts serving at the court, there was one who, though not of particularly high rank, was more attractive than the rest," contains the story of the love of Hikaru Genji's mother and his father, the emperor, and of Genji, born of their union, until he was the age of twelve.
