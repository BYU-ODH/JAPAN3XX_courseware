			<p align="center"><font style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: bold;">N（で）すら: <br>Even (preposition) N </font></p><hr><p class="normal"><b>Explanation:</b> すら is used to express the feeling of something that you would expect from N at least, but even N not coming through as you expected. This construction comes from a more general structure N (particle) + すら: When the N (noun) is the subject or the direct object of the sentence, then the particles are deleted. <br><br>例1. 日本人すら来なかった。<br>Not even the Japanese came. <br><br>In sentence 1, you would expect the Japanese to come for sure (at least Japanese would come.), but even they didn’t show up. However, if there are some particles in a sentence before adding すら, they are maintained as in sentences 2. <br><br>例2. 隣の町にすら行けなかった。<br>He could not even go to the next town. <br><br>In 2, you would expect for him to at least go to the next town but he was not even able to go. Although this structure is often used with negative sentences, they do not have to be negative as in the following example. <br><br>例3. あの人は夏ですらセーターを着ている。<br>He wears sweaters even in the summer. <br></p>		</td>
